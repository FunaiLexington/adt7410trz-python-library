# ADT7410TRZ Python Library

A simple python module to use the Analog Devices ADT7410TRZ Temperature Sensor (https://www.analog.com/en/products/adt7410.html)

This library uses the libmraa low level skeleton library for communication (https://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/mraa/)

This has been tested on an Intel Edison, but technically should be able to work on any platform for which libmraa is available.

This software is provided as-is.
